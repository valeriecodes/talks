					<h2 style='color:#fff'>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Unit Testing</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Hello and welcome to my talk on unit testing. I'm Valerie Woolard
						Srinivasan, I'm a software engineer at Panoply, where I help build
						tools for your favorite podcasts. Find me in the hallway later or
						on Twitter, my handle is valeriecodes, for podcast recommendations,
						but right now we're going to talk about testing.

					<h2>What are tests for?</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Let's start right off the bat with: What are tests even for in the
						first place? Some of you may be fairly new to software and just know
						that testing is probably something you should do without knowing why.
					</aside>

					<h3>Protecting against bugs</h3>
					<img src='images/bug.png'>
					<aside class='notes'>
						The software that you're working on is likely to be a very complex
						system. You're probably not going to be the only one modifying it,
						and it's not going to be possible to understand or keep track of
						what's going on in every part of the application.
						A test is an audit trail of how something is supposed to work. When
						a test fails, you should have some proof or paper trail of when that
						thing used to work so that you have an easier time identifying what
						broke it.
						Use tests to prove that your code does what you say it does when you
						write it.
						Ideally, you use a continous integration proccess to test your code
						every time there is a new commit. Good tests coupled with continuous
						integration will allow you to pinpoint and quickly correct any code
						that breaks your tests.

					</span>
					<aside class='notes'>
						If you're using continuous integration, tests have to be updated
						when they fail, so they are more likely to reflect the current
						state of the codebase than comments.
						In the above example, nothing forces the comment to be updated when the
						output of the function is actually switched to five. In a less trivial
						case, this could lead to comments giving future developers (including
						yourself!) misleading information about the actual state of the code.
						Good tests can serve as an introduction to your code. Well-written tests,
						along with well-named functions and variables,should explain the
						desired behavior of your code as well as testing

					<h3>Encouraging good practices</h3>
					<blockquote>Tests are the canary in the coal mine; when the design is bad, testing is hard.</blockquote>
					<span class="attribution">â€” Sandi Metz, <em>Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</em></span>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Writing tests as you write your code will help give you an idea of
						where the complexities in your code are. If you are not sure how to
						test a method, that method might be too complex and need to be
						broken up into smaller functionality.
						If you find yourself having to write lots of scaffolding in order
						to even run your tests, this can help to signal that the class you're
						working with might have too many external dependencies.
						The Law of Demeter in object oriented programming states that each
						unit should only have limited knowledge of other units, and that a
						unit should only talk to its immediate friends. Writing unit tests
						provides a great opportunity to test this. How much does your class
						actually need from neighboring classes? If it's too much, then writing
						unit tests will be more complicated.
					</aside>

					<h3>Allowing for confidence in refactor</h3>
					<img src='images/dangerously.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Without tests, it's impossible to make changes to your code and
						ensure that you haven't broken other things. Efficient refactoring
						is only possible with a well-written test suite.
						This is an example of how taking the time to write good tests will
						save you time in the future.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What makes testing hard?</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						So we've talked about what's good about tests and why you should write
						them, but we've probably all been or will be in situations where
						test-writing is skipped or overlooked. Why is that?
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Time</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Developer time</li>
						<li>Computational time</li>
						<li>The passage of time</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Writing tests takes time. The first time you're writing something,
						you're probably testing it manually in a development environment.
						You've already convinced yourself that it works, and it seems
						straightforward enough. Why write automated tests? That takes time
						that you could be spending writing your next feature.

						Tests also take time to run. By configuring a continous deployment
						environment in which you have to run tests before you deploy new code,
						in one deliberate way you are slowing down your deploy process. This
						can make it more frustrating to push urgent fixes through, especially
						if those tests take a long time to run or have spurious failures.

						Testing anything that involves time can also be challenging. What
						if you want to check that a time stamp was correctly recorded, but
						fractions of a second elapse between the time the object is saved and
						the test is run? What if your test server is on a different time
						zone than your development and production environments?

						These issues can be mitigated by using gems like Timecop, which
						allow you to freeze time in your testing environment.

						The final aspect of time that can be difficult is knowing at what
						point in the process to write your tests, and if you're waiting to
						write them until the end or trying to write them long after writing
						the code under test, it can be hard to remember what you were doing
						an what things are most important to test.

						Even if you're not using true test-driven development, you should be
						writing tests alongside your code, and writing out an idea of what
						you want your tests to look like before you begin writing code can be
						a helpful exercise in thinking about how to structure your code.
					</aside>

					<h3>Not knowing where to start</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>
						If you're faced with an app or codebase with no tests, it's daunting
						to try and figure out where to even start testing it.
						Instead of taking on the monumental task of writing tons of tests
						at once, instead make sure that every new piece of code that you add
						is well-tested. Choose a testing framework and use tools to get an
						idea of your test coverage. Chip away at it. Use the Boy Scout rule
						and leave the code cleaner and better-tested than you found it with
						every pull request.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>External systems</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Let's say that your code makes a call to an external API and then
						parses that response. It's inefficient and clunky to actually make
						that call every time you run your test, so what can you do?
						You have a few options. You can mock out a valid response in your
						tests and just make sure that you are doing the correct operations
						on it.
						You can use a tool like Webmock to construct fake HTTP responses,
						or a tool like VCR to make a real request once and record the result,
						performing all future tests from the recording.
						Keep in mind that both of these methods rely on the current state or
						your interpretation of the current state of the API response format,
						and that if that changes it may break your live app but not your tests.

					<h2>A Good Test Suite</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Fails when something is broken</li>
						<li>Doesn't fail otherwise</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class='notes'>
						A good test suite really only has to do two things. It needs to
						break when code that you've changed has broken your app, and not
						break otherwise. Both of these things are much easier said than
						done. As it turns out, it's very difficult to predict what parts
						of an application are most likely to break with future changes,
						and write tests in a way that exposes those changes.
						It's also quite easy to write tests that break in ways that don't
						actually indicate failures in your code, like a copy change or a
						change in the formatting of an output. You should also be wary of
						tests that might be prone to timeout or assume anything that could
						change, such as the year or anything about the environment it's
						being run in.

					<h2>Different types of tests</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Unit</li>
						<li>Integration</li>
						<li>Functional</li>
						<li>System</li>
						<aside class='notes'>
							So this talk is about unit testing, but we haven't really
							differentiated the different types of tests and what they mean.
							You'll hear slightly different definitions from different sources.
							These different designations are used in the Ruby on Rails guides.

							A unit test tests the smallest functional unit of code that it can,
							such as a single method of a single class.

							An integration test tests aspects of a particular workflow, and
							thus tests multiple modules and units of your software at once.
							You might create an integration test to make sure that users can
							log in or create accounts.

							Functional tests look at controller logic and interactions. They
							are testing that your application handles and responds to requests
							correctly.

							System tests allows test user interactions with your application,
							running tests in either a real or a headless browser.

							System tests are like an automated QA script, and probably most
							closely mirror the way you would perform manual QA in an automated
							environment.

					<h2>Why unit tests?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Easy to write</li>
						<li>Easy to run</li>
						<li>Easy to reason about</li>
						<li>Encourage simplicity</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Of the types of tests I talked about, you'll notice that unit tests
						are by far the simplest.
						I like them because they are easy to write, easy to run, easy to
						reason about, and also help to encourage modularity and cleaniness
						in your code as we discussed earlier.

						Individual methods are probably the things in your code that you
						have the best understanding of, making them the easiest to write
						good tests for. And if your code is clean and modular, well-tested
						units should lead to a functional application.

						Unit tests are also very fast to run, since they have the fewest
						dependencies and don't require spinning up a headless browser.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>When to write other tests</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						That said, there will be times when you have to write other types of
						tests, but you should be thoughtful about when those times are because
						of the overhead involved. It's probably a good idea to have integration
						tests for the most critical workflows in your app, or in the case of a
						company, the things that would be most likely to loose you money quickly
						if they broke.
