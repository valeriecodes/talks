					<h1>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Unit Testing</h1>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Hello and welcome to my talk on unit testing. I'm Valerie Woolard
						Srinivasan, I'm a software engineer at Panoply, where I help build
						tools for your favorite podcasts. Find me in the hallway later or
						on Twitter, my handle is valeriecodes, for podcast recommendations,
						but right now we're going to talk about testing.

					<h2>What are tests for?</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Let's start right off the bat with: What are tests even for in the
						first place? Some of you may be fairly new to software and just know
						that testing is probably something you should do without knowing why.

					<h3>Protecting against bugs</h3>
					<img src='images/bug.png'>
					<aside class='notes'>
						The software that you're working on is likely to be a very complex
						system. You're probably not going to be the only one modifying it,
						and it's not going to be possible to understand or keep track of
						what's going on in every part of the application.
						A test is an audit trail of how something is supposed to work. When
						a test fails, you should have some proof or paper trail of when that
						thing used to work so that you have an easier time identifying what
						broke it.
						Ideally, you use a continous integration proccess to test your code
						every time there is a new commit. Good tests coupled with continuous
						integration will allow you to pinpoint and quickly correct any code
						that breaks your tests.

def number
 # always returns 4
 4
end
					</code></pre>
				</span>
			</span>
			<span class="fragment fade-in">
				<pre><code>
def number
 # always returns 4
 5
end
				</code></pre>
			</span>
			<span class="fragment fade-in">
				<pre><code>
it 'always returns 4' do
 expect(number).to eq(4)
end
				</code></pre>
			</span>
			<aside class='notes'>
				If you're using continuous integration, tests have to be updated
				when they fail, so they are more likely to reflect the current
				state of the codebase than comments.
				Good tests can serve as an introduction to your code.
